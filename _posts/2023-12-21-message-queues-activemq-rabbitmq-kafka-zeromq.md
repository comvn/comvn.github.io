The list of key features:

1. **Asynchronous Communication**: Allows different parts of a system to communicate without needing to respond immediately, leading to more efficient use of resources.
2. **Decoupling of Services**: Enables services to operate independently, reducing the system's complexity and enhancing maintainability and scalability.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes messages evenly across different services or workers, helping to manage workload and improve system performance.
4. **Order Preservation**: Some message queues can ensure that messages are processed in the order they are sent, which is crucial for specific applications.
5. **Scalability**: Facilitates easy scaling of applications by adding more consumers or resources to handle increased message flow.
6. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Controls the rate at which messages are processed, which is important for managing resources and preventing system overloads.
7. **Fan-out Capability**: Message queues often include a fan-out mechanism, which allows a single message to be delivered to multiple consumers or services simultaneously.
8. **Data Persistence**: Offers the ability to store messages on disk or in memory until they are successfully processed, ensuring data is not lost in case of system failures.
9. **Message Filtering and Routing**: Allows messages to be routed or filtered based on specific criteria or content, enabling more targeted and efficient processing.

# Components

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-1s8357g.jpeg)

In the context of message queues, the concepts of producers, consumers, and messages form the core of how these systems operate.

1. **Producer** is an application or service responsible for creating and sending messages to the message queue. It does not need to be aware of who will process the message or when it will be processed.
2. **Consumer** is an application or service that retrieves and processes messages from the queue. It acts on the data sent by producers.
3. **Messages** are the data packets sent from producers to consumers. They can vary in size and format, ranging from simple text strings to complex data structures like JSON or XML.
4. **Message Broker** is a middleware tool that facilitates communication between different applications or services by receiving messages from a sender and routing them to the appropriate receiver. It typically provides features like message queuing, routing, transformation, and delivery assurance.

# Messaging Models

Globally, there are two types of messaging: Point-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe.

## Point-to-Point

<div style="float: left; margin: 2em 2em 2em 2em;width:40%">
<img src="https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-mta35lh.jpeg" alt="">
</div>
<p class="line-space" ><br></p>
<p>Messages sent by a producer are placed in a queue and are consumed by a single consumer. It ensures that each message is processed only once by one receiver.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

## Publish-Subscribe

<div style="float: left; margin: 2em 2em 2em 2em;width:40%">

</div>
<p class="line-space" ><br></p>
<p>Messages are published to a specific topic rather than a queue.
Multiple consumers can subscribe to a topic and receive messages broadcast to that topic.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

However, some messaging protocols and the brokers that support them use an additional Exchange component for routing. In that case, messages are published to an exchange in the broker first. The Exchange, acting as the routing agent, forwards these messages to the appropriate queue using its routing rules.

The following exchange operating modes are distinguished:

## Direct exchange

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-kkc354q.jpeg)

The message is routed to the queues whose binding key matches the message's routing key.

## Topic exchange

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-lwd35ma.jpeg)

The topic exchange will perform a wildcard match between the routing key and the routing pattern specified in the binding to publish messages to the queue.

## Fanout exchange

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-7ae35p5.jpeg)

A message sent to a fan-out exchange is copied and forwarded to all the queues bound to the exchange.

## Header exchange

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-vhf353s.jpeg)

Header exchanges will use the message header attributes for routing.

## Dead letter

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-u6g35el.jpeg)

Dead letter queues collect messages that couldnâ€™t be processed successfully for various reasons like processing errors, message expiration, or delivery issues.

# Protocols
