Any complex system is a mosaic of numerous components, each with its specific function. These components don't operate in isolation; they constantly interact over a network, exchanging data and commands. Understanding the basics of these interactions is crucial. https://hackernoon.com/the-system-design-cheat-sheet-networks

One must understand how components communicate over the network to comprehend the system's overall performance and resilience truly.

# Types

Networks can be divided into four types based on size, architecture, range, and function:

* **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Designed for personal use, usually within a person's range. It might connect devices like a computer, smartphone, and smartwatch, often Bluetooth.
* **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or school. It's typically used for connecting computers and sharing resources like printers or internet connections within a confined geographical area.
* **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Covers a larger area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN, typically spanning a city or a large campus. Local service providers often use it to offer connections to businesses and homes in a town.
* **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Spans a larger geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs. The internet is the most prominent example of a WAN, linking computers and networks worldwide.

# Components

Building and maintaining networks would be impossible without specialized hardware devices:

* **Cable & Wireless Access Point**: Physical cables (like Ethernet) provide a wired connection between devices, while wireless access points allow devices to connect to the network without physical cables, using Wi-Fi or other wireless technologies.
* **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: These are hardware components, often cards inserted into computers or other devices, that allow them to connect to a network.
* **Repeater**: A network device that amplifies or regenerates a signal, allowing it to travel longer distances without degradation. It's primarily used in wired and wireless networks to extend the range of communication and ensure data integrity over extended distances.
* **Bridge**: A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, adding the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of the source and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol.
* **Hub**: These basic networking devices connect multiple devices in a LAN, acting as a single network segment. Hub cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.
* **Switches**: Devices in a network that connect other devices. Unlike hubs, which broadcast the same data to all devices, switches are more intelligent, directing data only to the device that needs it.
* **Routers**: Devices that forward data packets between computer networks. They determine the best path for data transfer. Routers typically connect LANs and WANs and have a dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets.

#  Topologies

Network topology is a structural layout that dictates how different network devices and components are connected and how data is transmitted. The choice of topology significantly impacts the network's performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. It is categorized into two main types:

* **Physical**: Describes the physical layout of devices, cables, and other network components. It represents how network devices are physically connected.
* **Logical**: Describes the data flow within the network, regardless of its physical design. It represents how data is transmitted between network devices.

The following types of topologies are distinguished:

## Point-to-Point

A direct connection between two nodes or endpoints. This is the simplest form of network topology.

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-bwi3bf3.png)

**Advantages:**
* The direct and dedicated link ensures high-speed data transfer.
* Simple configuration and setup.
* Reliable communication since there are only two nodes involved.
**Disadvantages:**
* It is not scalable for larger networks as it would require a dedicated line for every pair of devices.
* It can be more expensive in scenarios where multiple connections are needed due to the need for individual links.

## Bus

All devices share a single communication line. Data sent by a device is available to all other devices, but only the intended recipient accepts and processes that data.

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-yzl3bpg.png)

**Advantages:**
* Easy to implement for small networks.
* Cost-effective due to minimal cabling.
**Disadvantages:**
* Performance degrades as more devices are added or network traffic increases.
* A single cable failure can bring down the entire network.

## Ring

Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. Data travels in one or sometimes two directions.

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-yzl3bpg.png)

**Advantages:**
* It can handle larger data loads than bus topology.
**Disadvantages:**
* A failure in one cable or device can take down the entire network.
* More difficult to install and reconfigure.

## Star

All devices are connected to a central device (e.g., a switch or hub).

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-wym3b9i.png)

**Advantages:**
* Easy to install and manage.
* Failure in one cable doesn't affect other devices.
**Disadvantages:**
* If the central device fails, the whole network is inoperable.
* Requires more cable than bus topology.

## Tree

Hybrid topology that combines characteristics of star and bus topologies. Groups of star-configured networks are connected to a linear bus backbone.

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-wmo3bpp.png)

**Advantages:**
* Hierarchical and scalable.
* Grouping of devices makes it easy to manage.
**Disadvantages:**
* Failure in the backbone will cause division in the network.
* More cabling is required than other topologies.

## Mesh

Devices are interconnected. Every device is connected to every other device.

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-npq3bfc.png)

**Advantages:**
* Provides high redundancy and reliability.
* Data can be transmitted from multiple devices simultaneously.
**Disadvantages:**
* It requires more cabling, making it expensive.
* Complex to install and configure.

## Hybrid

Combination of two or more topologies.

![](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/iOvSeC4bWUctj2q3XImABGDqXVO2-kys3bwx.png)

**Advantages:**
* Flexible and reliable as it inherits the advantages of its component topologies.
* Scalable.
**Disadvantages:**
* Complex design.
* It can be more expensive due to multiple configurations.

# Protocols

Network protocols are rules or standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. These protocols ensure that devices on a network (or across multiple networks) can communicate with each other in a standardized way.

Common Protocols
TCP/IP: The fundamental suite of protocols that powers the Internet. TCP ensures data is sent correctly, and IP provides data is sent to the correct place.
UDP: A connectionless protocol that, unlike TCP, doesn't establish a connection before sending data and doesn't guarantee the order of data packets.
HTTP, HTTPS: Protocols used for transferring web pages on the Internet. HTTPS includes security measures to encrypt data.
FTP: A protocol designed to transfer files over a network.
SMTP: Used for email transmission.
IMAP: Used for retrieving and storing emails from a mail server.
POP3: Used for retrieving emails from a mail server.
ICMP: Used for error reporting and diagnostics related to IP processing.
DNS: Translates domain names to IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using human-readable names.
DHCP: Assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices on a network.
SSL/TLS: Cryptographic protocols are designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.
PPP: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is basically an asymmetric protocol suite for various connections or links without framing.
Ethernet: Defines how devices on a local area network (LAN) communicate. It operates at both the physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model.

7. **Database: Storing** frequently accessed database queries and results to speed up future requests.

# Top Caching Strategies

## Cache Aside

![](/img/posts/cache/cache_02-min.svg)

Also known as "Lazy Loading," this strategy involves loading data into the cache on demand. When an application requests data, it first checks the cache. If the data is not found (cache miss), it is fetched from the database and stored in the cache for future requests.

**Pros:**
* Prevents unnecessary data from being loaded into the cache.
* Offers fine-grained control over what is cached.

**Cons:**
* This can lead to increased latency for cache misses as the application must wait for data to be loaded from the database.
* Requires additional complexity in application code to manage caching logic.

## Read Through

![](/img/posts/cache/cache_03-min.svg)

In this approach, data is automatically loaded into the cache from the database when there is a cache miss. The application only interacts with the cache and not directly with the database for read operations.

**Pros:**
* Simplifies application logic as the caching layer handles data loading.
* Ensures that only requested data is loaded into the cache, saving space.

**Cons:**
* Initial read operations may be slower due to cache misses and subsequent database access.
* The cache can become a bottleneck if it is not efficiently managed.

## Write Around

![](/img/posts/cache/cache_04-min.svg)

When data is written, it is written directly to the database and not to the cache. The cache is only updated when data is read.

**Pros:**
* Reduces cache churn by avoiding caching data that is infrequently read.
* Minimizes the risk of cache and database getting out of sync.

**Cons:**
* Can lead to slower read operations following a write, as the data must be loaded into the cache from the database.
* May increase database load since every write goes directly to the database.

## Write Back (Write Behind)

![](/img/posts/cache/cache_05-min.svg)

Data is first written to the cache and then, after a certain amount of time or under certain conditions, written back to the database. This allows for batch updates.

**Pros:**
* Improves write performance as operations are done quickly in the cache.
* Reduces database load by batching write operations.

**Cons:**
* Risk of data loss if the cache fails before data is written back to the database.
* Complexity in ensuring that the cache and database are eventually synchronized.

## Write Through

![](/img/posts/cache/cache_06-min.svg)

Data is written simultaneously to the cache and the database. This ensures data consistency between the cache and database.

**Pros:**
* Guarantees data consistency as writes to the cache and database are synchronous.
* Easy to implement and understand.

**Cons:**
* Can lead to higher latency for write operations as they must be completed in both cache and database.
* Increased load on the database for every write operation.

# Cache Eviction Policies

Cache eviction policies are critical in caching systems due to the limited size of caches; they ensure optimal use of available space by determining which data to retain or discard. These policies enhance overall cache performance by keeping the most relevant data accessible while maintaining data accuracy and consistency by removing outdated or less frequently used information.

The most well-known strategies include the following:

1. **First In, First Out (FIFO):** Evicts the oldest items in the cache first, regardless of their usage frequency.
2. **Least Recently Used (LRU):** Evicts the least recently accessed items first, assuming that items not accessed recently are less likely to be accessed in the future.
3. **Most Recently Used (MRU):** Opposite of LRU, it evicts the most recently used items first. This can be useful when the most recent items are less likely to be reaccessed.
4. **Least Frequently Used (LFU):** Prioritizes eviction of least frequently accessed items, assuming frequent access implies future relevance.
5. **Most Frequently Used (MFU):** Eviction policy is a cache eviction strategy where the cache identifies and removes the data items that are accessed most frequently.
6. **Random Replacement (RR):** Randomly selects a cache item to evict, which can be simpler to implement and effective in specific scenarios.
7. **Size-Based Eviction:** Evicts items based on their size to manage the memory footprint, often used in combination with other policies.

# Cache invalidation

In addition to removing infrequently accessed items, caches often contain data that becomes obsolete or stale. These outdated cache entries need to be identified and slated for removal.

The most well-known strategies include the following:

1. **Time to Live (TTL):** Data is invalidated after a specified duration. When the TTL expires, the cached data is either automatically removed or marked as invalid. There are two approaches:
    * **Active expiration:** A background process or thread periodically scans the cache to check the TTL of cache entries.
    * **Passive expiration:** Checks the TTL of a cache entry at its access time.
2. **Write-Invalidate:** When data is updated in the primary storage, corresponding cache entries are invalidated. This ensures consistency between the cache and the source.
3. **Change Notification:** The cache listens for notifications from the data source about changes. When notified, the cache invalidates the relevant entries.
4. **Polling:** The cache periodically checks the validity of its entries by comparing them with the source data.
